I"“<p>We live in a world of <strong>appearances</strong>. The amount of time we spent at the office 
is not equals to the amount of work we <strong>do</strong>.</p>

<p>We get paid to <strong>pretend</strong> to be working 8 o 9 hours per day. But the reality is 
that we donâ€™t exactly spend that amount of time <strong>working</strong>. We spent/waste time 
on meetings, chatting, discussing, etc.</p>
