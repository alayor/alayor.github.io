I"r<p>We live in a world of <strong>appearances</strong>. The amount of time we spent at the office 
is not equals to the amount of work we <strong>do</strong>.</p>

<p>We get paid to <strong>pretend</strong> to be working 8 o 9 hours per day. But the reality is 
that we don’t exactly spend that amount of time <strong>working</strong>. We spent/waste time 
on meetings, chatting, discussing, etc.</p>

<!--excerpt_end-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/landscape.jpg" alt="Required" /></p>

<p>Even if we have conversations about the project or about how to solve misunderstandings 
in requirements, we are <strong>wasting</strong> our time by doing these things.</p>

<p>This is not <strong>fair</strong> to employers and workers. As employers lose their <strong>money</strong> 
and workers lose their <strong>time</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, some companies are changing the way people get products and services 
by <strong>sharing time and space</strong> in a more flexible way.</p>

<p>We can see this change in companies like Uber or AirBnb which allow <em>workers</em> to share 
its own space and time.</p>

<p>We need to apply this change to services like <strong>software development</strong>.</p>

<p>We can do this by being more <strong>flexible</strong> about the amount of time developers work 
for a particular project.</p>

<p><strong>Developers and designers should be able to share their time among projects.</strong></p>

<p>There is a better way to <strong>compensate</strong> workers based on the <strong>value</strong> they bring to the project. 
And this approach involves having a <strong>better distribution</strong> of the time they <strong>interact</strong> with the project.</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to change is the way we <strong>measure effort</strong>. But the fact that we 
should spent exactly 8 hours per day in the office doesn’t help the cause.</p>

<p>This is one of the many advantages of <strong>Freelancing</strong>. The employers only pay for the hours
a worker (Developer or Designer) is actually <u>working</u>. And at the same time the developers 
are able to be involved in different kinds of projects – allowing them to <strong>learn and earn</strong> more.</p>

<p>There are many companies that provide services that allow employers to <strong>find freelancers</strong> and at the same
time help developers use their time to work on <strong>different projects</strong>.</p>

<p>Probably the best and most famous company is <em><strong><a href="https://www.toptal.com/software" target="_blank">Toptal</a></strong></em>, 
which not only provides this service but also helps the employers to be connected with <strong>high-skilled 
freelancers</strong> which guarantees success in any project.</p>

<p>However, this is only the first step to achieve a better way of <strong>manage compensation</strong>.</p>

<p>If we analyze closely the work done in open source projects, we can see that it involves <strong>commits</strong>, 
<strong>defects detection</strong>, defects solutions, tickets, <strong>pull requests</strong>, code reviews.</p>

<p><strong>And all these contributions are measurable.</strong></p>

<p>We should be able to use these metrics to <strong>calculate</strong> how much a Developer/Designer <strong>should earn</strong>.
In order to know how much a worker will <strong>get paid</strong>, we should take into account the number of commits, 
defects solved, defects found, pull requests, etc.</p>

<p><em>We should not only measure the time a worker spent in the office.</em></p>

<p>There is an existing and interesting idea by <em><strong><a href="http://yegor256.com/" target="_blank">_yegor256</a></strong></em>
called <em><strong><a href="http://www.xdsd.org/" target="_blank">eXtremely Distributed Software Development</a></strong></em> which has a smart 
solution to calculate the amount of money a developer should earn based on its <strong>contributions</strong>
to the project.</p>

<p>It’s highly <strong>recommendable</strong> that you, as developer or designer, join the world of <strong>freelancing</strong>. 
This will help you become a great developer and earn much more than what you earn at a <em>9-5</em> job.</p>
