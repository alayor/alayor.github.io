I"9<p>There are two types of communication that we use to share information within our team.
These are <strong>written</strong> communication and <strong>verbal</strong> communication.</p>

<p>When is it better to use one over the other?</p>

<p>In other words, when should we <em>write</em> instead of <em>talk</em>?</p>

<p>We tend to believe that speaking is more <strong>effective</strong> when we are trying to share information.
Verbal communication has <strong>quicker</strong> results and it allows us to have more personal contact with whom we are speaking.</p>
