I"É<p><em>â€œThis feature is not correct. The process should be done <strong>biweekly</strong> â€“ twice
a week,â€</em> - The analyst said, <em>â€œThis is totally different from the
feature I requested.â€</em></p>

<p>This was the <strong>second</strong> demo meeting held with the business analyst to show
this new feature and it was the second rejection.</p>

<p><em>â€œWe thought â€˜biweeklyâ€™ meant every two weeks,â€</em> The programmer said,
<em>â€œWe tried to follow verbatim every requirement in the user story, but
it seems it has ambiguities in some parts.â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œFair enough, Iâ€™ll revisit it and try to correct any ambiguityâ€</em> - The
analyst agreed.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the <strong>cost</strong> of this kind of misinterpretations? What can we do to
<strong>avoid</strong> them?</p>

<p>The reason why we donâ€™t use <em>plain english</em> to write code is because it
can cause ambiguities that makes it <strong>difficult</strong> to read.</p>

<p>Software specifications are written mostly in english â€“ so when 
interpreters (or programmers) try to process them, we sometimes 
end up with a software <strong>misbehavior</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Behavior-Driven Development</strong> is a process that intends to solve this
kind of problems by providing a common language that a <em>business analyst</em>
and a <em>computer</em> can <strong>read</strong> and process.</p>

<p>There are several tools, like <em><strong><a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a></strong></em>, that can be used to
implement BDD.
Cucumber is a framework that provides a <strong>common language</strong> used to write
software specifications.</p>

<p>Cucumber allows users to create <em>feature</em> files that analysts can use to
write specifications and define the <strong>behaviour</strong> of new features as well
as the entire system.</p>

<p>Likewise, these files can be <strong>read by a computer</strong> and can be used to
execute functional tests in order to find out if a particular behaviour
is being executed <strong>correctly</strong>.</p>

<p>The main purpose of BDD is to solve <strong>communication problems</strong> inside a software
development team.</p>

<p>Moreover, we can use this tool in an <em>interesting way</em>
when the specifications are <strong>defined prior</strong> the development of a new feature.</p>

<p><strong>By having all the specifications defined previously, we can test anytime
if our current development is meeting these requirements.</strong></p>

<p>We can also test if we are breaking existing functionality.</p>

<p>BDD allows software development teams keep <strong>one source of truth</strong> that
enables the team <strong>agreed</strong> on the <strong>real intention</strong> and purpose of any old
and new feature.</p>

<p>Teams can finally <strong>stop having misinterpretations</strong> and communication
problems when delivering new functionality.</p>
