I"v<p>Should I test all setters and getters? What about testing code that I don’t own?
Should I use pure TDD without skipping any steps?</p>

<p>The short answer is: Yes.</p>

<p>But the long answer is: Yes, you should.</p>

<p>We shouldn’t set any limit to quality, we should always strive to get perfect each line
of code and build 100% bug-free software solutions.</p>
