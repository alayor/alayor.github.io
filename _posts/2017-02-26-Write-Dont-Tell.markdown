There are two types of communication that we use to share information in our team.
**Written and verbal communication**.
When is it **better** to use one over the other?

In other words, when should we _write_ instead of _talk_?

We tend to believe that speaking is more **effective** when we try to **share information**.
Verbal communication has **quicker** results and it allows to have more personal contact
with the receptor.

Also, you don't have to worry much about **grammar** when you use verbal communication. If you
make a grammar mistake, nobody really cares.

Although verbal communication seems the way to go in many situations,
it can cause many **problems** in the long run.

Problems arise when we use verbal communication to make **promises**, give **instructions**
or share information.

<u>If we make promises or give instructions verbally, we don't have a way to prove
that these promises and instructions were indeed given.</u>

Let's suppose you manager asks you to do something just
by using verbal communication. Your manager gave you precise instructions
on how to perform the job and she even advised you about the steps you need to take
should you encounter any problem.

Now, you can just **memorize** everything in case you have the ability to do it.
If you don't, you could write all the instructions carefully in a piece of paper
in order not to **forget** anything.

Then, you follow all the specified steps and put all your effort in order to
finish you task on time.

Later on, when you let your manager know you have finished, she reviews it
and tells you that you **didn't do it the way she told you so**.

<u>How can you prove you did?</u>

Obviously, you can discuss with her and you can show her your pice of paper with
the instructions just as she required.

But, even if you did do it the way you supposed to do -- <u>you cannot prove it</u>.

Probably it would it be different if you had ask your manager to send you
an **email** with all the instructions.

Had your manager written an email with the instructions, this situation
would have been different.

Verbal communication gives us a **feeling of productivity** and makes us think
that we are making the most of our time.

It gives us the perception that information and **knowledge is spread** effectively
across the team.

But the reality is that this knowledge **gets lost in the air**, when we
could have *saved it* in some document.

**Meetings** are the perfect example of **wasting time** when using verbal communication.
There's no point in having a meeting if a **document** is not created that reflects the
intention, results or action items from that meeting.

Think about the last meeting you had. Someone was probably giving some explanations,
instructions or **answers**; and everyone understood well what was being said.

But some time after this meeting, it was difficult to **retain** such
amount of information.

It would have been better to **publish** some kind of document and give people the opportunity
to **<u>write questions and opinions</u>** on it.

There is also a problem when we are **sharing knowledge** or exchanging information.
If we use **verbal** communication, all this **information is lost**.

To give example, let's suppose you are working with your team and suddenly you find yourself
with many questions about a particular code you don't understand.

<u>What's the first thing you do to solve this problem?</u>

Ask a question, of course.

So, you go ahead and approach some teammate and ask your questions.
Then, your teammate happily answers you.
And you happily resolve your problem.

But then, after 1 year, some other teammates have asked the **same questions** you asked
about the **same piece of code** and all of them received there answers.

The problem here is that -- although many people received answers about this piece of code --
the **knowledge** about this code is still with just **one person**.

Unless someone else had **written down and save** this information.

This problem could be solved by making people just interact using **Q&A tools** and **prohibit**
verbal communication. This of course sound something difficult to achieve.

Remote teams offer an advantage about this problem. Although people in remote teams could
certainly interact using some voice chat tool, there are more chances that **information**
and knowledge **get preserved** in some bug tracker or documentation tool.

Verbal communication is an excellent way to make personal contact and give
**inspiration** in meetings, but fails when it comes to **knowledge sharing and preservation**.

Written communication, on the other hand, allows us to provide information in a more
structured way and gives us the opportunity to **save this information** for further
analysis and **knowledge sharing**.
