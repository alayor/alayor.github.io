One day a manager asked a developer to create some **new feature**
for a particular system.

The developer agrees to deliver this new feature with the **best
quality** possible and that she will put all her effort to create bug-free code.

This developer will code on her own and **with nobody's help**.

The developer then started to think what could be the best way to deliver
a product with absolutely **no bugs**. 

_"I surely need to create unit tests"_, The developer thought.

But then, the developer asked herself **how many** unit tests she should create.
Should it be one unit test **per method**? Should I use TDD? Should I achieve
100% coverage? Do I really need to create **that much** amount of tests?

**Do I really need to create tests at all?**

She found herself in a situation in which nobody was going to 
review her work. Nobody was going to complain if she **doesn't write** the tests.

Why? Because simply managers and leaders didn't care.

**What would you do in this case?**

Let's say that you particularly learnt a few week ago about TDD and the importance
of **not only** create unit tests - but to create them **first**.

And let's say that you convinced yourself that TDD is the **way to go** 
but somehow your coworkers and managers **don't agree** with you. How much should 
you try to **talk them into** about apply TDD in your current project?

It really takes so much work - _and sometimes bravery_ - to propose your ideas to others
and try to **convince** them.

But the reality is that if you manage to create **persuasion skills** so that you can 
convince people about your new ideas, you will surely become more that just an _**average
developer**_.

It just takes a little time and effort to **improve** these kind of skills. 
Basically, the first step is to **recognize** that you have a lack of expertise on 
them (even if your an expert) in order to start studying techniques by reading 
books or articles online.

One technique that results particularly **interesting** to me is the story of the 
_**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup" target="_blank">Stone Soup</a>**_. 
Which tells us a wat to **convince** people through **actions** instead of only words.

The skills a **professional developer** must have don't rely only on how to write 
**beautiful code** or know everything about algorithms and data structures. 

The **real** professional developer stands out when it adds negotiation, 
**persuasion** and pragmatism to her set of skills.
