We live in a world of **appearances**. The amount of time we spent at the office 
is not equals to the amount of work we **do**.

We get paid to **pretend** to be working 8 o 9 hours per day. But the reality is 
that we don’t exactly spend that amount of time **working**. We spent/waste time 
on meetings, chatting, discussing, etc.

Even if we have conversations about the project or about how to solve misunderstandings 
in requirements, we are **wasting** our time by doing these things.

This is not **fair** to employers and workers. As employers lose their **money** 
and workers lose their **time**.

Currently, some companies are changing the way people get products and services 
by **sharing time and space** in a more flexible way. 

We can see this change in companies like Uber or AirBnb which allow _workers_ to share 
its own space and time. 

We need to apply this change to services like **software development**. 

We can do this by being more **flexible** about the amount of time developers work 
for a particular project. 

**Developers and designers should be able to share their time among projects.**

There is a better way to **compensate** workers based on the **value** they bring to the project. 
And this approach involves having a **better distribution** of the time they **interact** with the project. 

The first thing that needs to change is the way we **measure effort**. But the fact that we 
should spent exactly 8 hours per day in the office doesn’t help the cause.

This is one of the many advantages of **Freelancing**. The employers only pay for the hours
a worker (Developer or Designer) is actually <u>working</u>. And at the same time the developers 
are able to be involved in different kinds of projects -- allowing them to **learn and earn** more.

There are many companies that provide services that allow employers to **find freelancers** and at the same
time help developers use their time to work on **different projects**.

Probably the best and most famous company is _**<a href="https://www.toptal.com/software" target="_blank">Toptal</a>**_, 
which not only provides this service but also helps the employers to be connected with **high-skilled 
freelancers** which guarantees success in any project.

However, this is only the first step to achieve a better way of **manage compensation**.

If we analyze closely the work done in open source projects, we can see that it involves **commits**, 
**defects detection**, defects solutions, tickets, **pull requests**, code reviews. 

**And all these contributions are measurable.**

We should be able to use these metrics to **calculate** how much a Developer/Designer **should earn**.
In order to know how much a worker will **get paid**, we should take into account the number of commits, 
defects solved, defects found, pull requests, etc. 

_We should not only measure the time a worker spent in the office._

There is an existing and interesting idea by _**<a href="http://yegor256.com/" target="_blank">_yegor256</a>**_
called _**<a href="http://www.xdsd.org/" target="_blank">eXtremely Distributed Software Development</a>**_ which has a smart 
solution to calculate the amount of money a developer should earn based on its **contributions**
to the project.

It's highly **recommendable** that you, as developer or designer, join the world of **freelancing**. 
This will help you become a great developer and earn much more than what you earn at a _9-5_ job.
